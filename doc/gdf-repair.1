gdf-repair \- fix broken gdf files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBgdf\-repair\fP <in\-file> <out\-file>
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The gdf file format writes some metadata such as events right at the end of the
file. This means that all those metadata need to be saved right up until the
end, and appended after the eeg data just before closing the file.
.sp
Should something go wrong (ie. crash), the file will not be closed correctly!
Instead of loosing all that data that can only be written when closing,
xdffileio save it in two temporary files respectively called *.event and *.code
.sp
\fBgdf\-repair\fP makes use of those two temporary files and recreate a full
gdf file by merging those three.
